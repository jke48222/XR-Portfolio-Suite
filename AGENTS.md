# AGENTS Instructions

Scope: Entire repository.

- Favor clarity and maintainability over cleverness; prefer small, composable classes.
- Keep diffs minimal: avoid drive-by refactors unrelated to the task.
- Preserve existing namespaces and folder structure; do not relocate Unity scripts unless required.
- Use 4-space indentation and `var` sparingly (only when the type is obvious from the right-hand side).
- Document performance-related decisions with short comments near the relevant code.
- When adding tests or commands, list what was run in the final response.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies without explaining why they are needed for Meta Quest targets.
