# XR Portfolio Suite – Capture Guide (Trailer and Recruiter Demo)

This guide defines repeatable capture workflows so each app can produce consistently premium footage.

## 1. Capture Goals
- Stable visuals: no flicker, no jitter, no broken occlusion.
- Clean composition: strong silhouettes, readable scale, minimal UI clutter.
- Repeatability: a fixed "hero script" that can be recorded multiple times.

## 2. In-App Capture Mode (Required)
Each app must include a Capture Mode toggle that:
- disables debug overlay and logs
- hides non-essential UI
- selects High quality tier (if safe)
- uses cinematic transitions for opening and closing sequences
- provides a "shot list" overlay in DEV only

## 3. Hero Script Template
Each app must define 5 to 8 repeatable moments.

Example structure:
1) cold open: instantly shows the concept
2) interaction close-up: hands or tools doing something impressive
3) system reveal: multiple elements or anchors visible at once
4) polish moment: lighting, particles, stability
5) closing shot: brand-like signature moment

## 4. MR Visual Symphony Shot List (Baseline)
- Place 3 anchors quickly
- Switch preset (visual language changes dramatically)
- Conduct a beat drop with visible room-scale response
- Close-up: ribbon detail interacting with occlusion
- Wide shot: full composition across room

## 5. Elemental Sandbox Shot List (Baseline)
- One clean gesture triggers a stable, satisfying effect
- Drill: target hit with obvious feedback
- Combo chain: two moves together
- Precision shot: slow, controlled motion with high fidelity visuals
- Hero burst: show power then return to calm

## 6. Pocket Portals Shot List (Baseline)
- Portal seed placement on desk
- Portal bloom open with cinematic edge shader
- Lean-in shot: interior diorama detail
- Spill effect moment: particles drifting into real room
- Two portals composition shot

## 7. Capture Hygiene Rules
- Keep hands and tools within comfortable tracking volume.
- Avoid fast rotations or violent movements that trigger motion blur artifacts.
- Always record at least 3 takes per shot and pick the most stable.

## 8. Deliverables per App
- 60 to 120 second trailer
- 5 to 10 screenshots
- 1 short technical breakdown clip (optional but strong signal)
